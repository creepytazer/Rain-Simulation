# Rain-Simulation
A fun little project I made to simulate 2D rainfall.
Not very complex. Uses a BFS algorithm to spill water and then backtrack leaks to erase the water.
customize board size at the top-left, pick what action your doing (placing blocks, rainclouds, or eraser) at the top-right
play the game from the middle. You can click and drag placables too.
Concept Idea.
